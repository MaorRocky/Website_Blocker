# Website_Blocker
Like a lot of people i'm also addicted to the internet hence i find myslef easily distracted by it. I created a small python program which blocks specifc sites which i have hard coded in the script itself. When the user run the script the program prompts for a time interval which is called "working hours" during that time the program will block the browser from accessing the host name.
